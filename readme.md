# Hangboarding Timer (under construction)

## Info

Timer for hang boarding and building finger strength for climbing.

Enter desired number of seconds to prepare, hang and rest between sets and the number of sets and see a visual timer.

Login to store session data and view previous max hang data plotted on a graph (graph created using the [recharts]('recharts.org') node module).

## Stack (so far)

- MongoDB
- Express
- React.js
- Node.js
- Auth0

## Under construction

When fully featured timer will have audio alerts, store progress in user accounts and show data in a graph.

At present timer is fully functioning. Users can log in with Auth0 and see stored max hang data as a graph.

### Still to do:

- Add sound
- Refine styling
- Deploy
